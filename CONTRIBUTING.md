# Contributing to GoZen

Thank you for considering contributing to the GoZen project, your help is greatly appreciated! This document outlines the guidelines and expectations for contributing to the GoZen project. Please take a moment to review the information below before making any contributions.

## Project overview

GoZen is an open-source video editor developed using the Godot game engine (version 4.3+). The primary languages used are C++ and GDScript. The project is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license, this is due to using FFmpeg with the GPL licensed codec support which is required for the encoding of videos. GoZen will stay open-source under the GPL license, even if we end up moving away from FFmpeg. 

## Getting started

To contribute to GoZen, make sure you have the following:

- [Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/download/);
- [Familiarity with GDScript and Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/);

Extra points which are not required but could be helpful:

- Familiarity with C++ could also help for the GDExtension side of things;
- GDExtension knowledge;
- Video file/format knowledge;
- Audio file knowledge;

The Godot version will stay the most up to date with the stable releases of Godot, unless breaking bugs are present which would stop GoZen from working correctly.

## How to contribute

1. [Fork the project on GitHub to create your own copy](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/GoZen/fork);
1. Create a new branch in your forked repository with a descriptive name for the changes you plan on making;
1. [Open a pull request from your branch to the main repository](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/GoZen/compare);
1. Wait for code review and feedback from the project maintainer (you will be notified through the pull request);
1. Address any feedback or requested changes and update your pull request;
1. Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

If you want to work on multiple things at once, please create multiple branches as merging these changes will otherwise become more difficult to differentiate.
